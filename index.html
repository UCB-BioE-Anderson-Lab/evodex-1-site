            <h2>About EVODEX.1</h2>
            <p>
                EVODEX is a framework for understanding how enzymes transform molecules.
                It helps researchers figure out which products can be formed from a given starting molecule,
                determining the mechanistic plausibility of potential transformations,
                and interpreting biochemical data.
                This is useful in areas like metabolic engineering, drug discovery,
                interpreting lab data, and enabling AI to reason about biochemistry.
            </p>
            <p>
                EVODEX.1 is a release of the EVODEX (Enzymatic Validation Operator Differentiation and Extraction) framework that abstracts enzymatic reactions derived from the BRENDA database
                to generate a family of named operators.
                These include representations of full and partial reactions, mass and formula changes,
                and mechanistic patterns derived from sigma and pi bonding interactions.
                Additionally, it provides algorithms for using the operators.

            <p>
                The “.1” indicates that this is version 1 of EVODEX. All operator identifiers are namespaced with this version number (e.g., EVODEX.1-R12), so they can be uniquely referenced and distinguished from past and future versions.
            </p>

                These links provide a browsable, website-based version of the EVODEX.1 dataset. Each page is internally hyperlinked, allowing you to explore relationships between operators and navigate between related abstractions. If you prefer working offline or programmatically, the full set of operators is also available for download as CSV files in our 
                <a href="https://github.com/UCB-BioE-Anderson-Lab/EVODEX/tree/main/evodex/data" target="_blank">GitHub data directory</a>.
                When using EVODEX via PyPI, these operator files are included with the library.

            <h2>Focused Subsets for Synthesis and Mass Spectrometry</h2>
            <p>
                These focused subsets of the EVODEX.1 dataset support specific EVODEX use cases.
                The synthesis subset includes EVODEX-E operators filtered to remove ubiquitous cofactors simplifying the process of 
                predicting biosynthetic pathways in a cellular context. The mass spectrometry subset is derived from EVODEX-M and includes 
                only transformations consistent with mass shifts observed between single ions, that is, where either the substrate or 
                product consists of a single molecular species. This restricts the set to transformations that would plausibly relate the 
                masses of two peaks in an LCMS trace through a substrate/product relationship, enabling mechanistic interpretation of 
                observed mass differences.
